                    to come. It is important to consider your passions, interests, values, and strengths when making
                    this decision. It may also be helpful to research various industries and jobs to understand the
                    duties, job outlook, and required skills for each option. It is also a good idea to speak with
                    professionals in your desired field and seek guidance from mentors or career counsellors. It is
                    important to keep in mind that your career is a journey and it is okay to make changes along the

            <p class="sectionTag p-big">Coding is the most powerful tool.</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag p-small">Coding refers to the process of writing instructions for computers to
                follow in order to perform specific tasks. It is a critical component of computer science and
                technology, as it allows developers to create software, websites, and mobile applications. There are
                many programming languages, each with its own syntax and capabilities, including popular languages such
                as Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript. Coding requires problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and
                the ability to think logically. As technology continues to play an increasingly important role in our
                lives, coding has become a valuable skill in many industries. Learning to code can also be a fulfilling
                and creative experience, as it allows individuals to bring their ideas to life and make a positive
                impact on the world.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag p-small">Books have the power to break down barriers and bridge divides. They
                provide a window into different cultures, perspectives, and ways of life, allowing us to expand our
                understanding of the world and the people around us. By reading, we can challenge our own beliefs and
                broaden our horizons. Through literature, we can experience empathy and gain insights into the human
                condition, helping us to develop greater compassion and understanding. Books have the power to inspire,
                educate, and entertain, making them an invaluable tool for personal growth and social change. Whether it
                is a novel, a biography, or a work of non-fiction, books have the ability to arm us with knowledge,
                provide us with new perspectives, and equip us with the tools we need to make a positive impact on the
                world.</p>
